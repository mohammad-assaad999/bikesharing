# Bikesharing
## Overview of the statistical analysis
  In this project, I'll be working on convincing investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. For this analysis, I'll be using Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I'll be creating a set of visualizations.
  
## Results
### Checkout Times for Users

In the first visualization, we can see that most of the users have a checkout time between 1 and 25 minutes, but the highest number of users have a checkout number of 5 minutes.

As we said before, the majority of the users are male. In addition the best timing for the users to bike is between 6 am till 9 am and between 4 pm till 8 pm from Monday to Friday. However, we can see that On saturday and Sunday, the users bike between 10 am and 5 pm.

In general, the relationship between birth year and trip length, according to the data, is that the later the birth year, the longer the ride duration.

Finally, as we said before, the male users are taking the majority of using the bikes furing the week. According to the above Pie chart, the male users are almos 80% of the total users. 

## Summary
In brief, we can say that the male subscribers are the most biking users who mostly bike between 6 am till 9 am and between 4 pm till 8 pm from Monday to Friday for a period of 10 to 20 minutes. To finalize the summary, talking about the stoptime and startime charts and graphs is also very important because they give us an idea of where the bikes stops should be.
