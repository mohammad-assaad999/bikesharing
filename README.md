# Bikesharing
## Overview of the statistical analysis
  In this project, I'll be working on convincing investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. For this analysis, I'll be using Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I'll be creating a set of visualizations.
  
## Results
